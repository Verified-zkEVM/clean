# Proof Finding Guide

This document describes certain well-tredded paths for finding proofs. These are just suggestions that might work.

## Opening moves

* The simpset `circuit_norm` is supposed to bring the goal state to well-treadded forms: `simp only [circuit_norm]`.
* Often `Subcircuit.circuit` `Subcircuit.Assumption` and `Subcircuit.Spec` need to be unfolded.
* In many cases, it's needed to keep unfolding things so that only the math content remains.

## In the middle

* The most usual moves are just `simp only [...]`.
* Most `Clean` definitions are meant to be unfolded away.
  * Clean's subcircuit mechanism prevents you from seeing the internal operations of subcircuits, so it's usually fine to unfold everything that you don't know about.
  * Exceptionally, it's usually better not to unfold loop constructions like `Circuit.foldl`, `Circuit.map`. Usually it's beneficial to state a separate lemma for lifting properties to the loop.
* When a context has an assumption `h : something â†’ something`, probably it's helpful to `specialize h (by ...)`. 
* If math is involved, you use lemmas from Mathlib or `Utils`. The goal state in Clean is usually too large for `rw?` (and also usually for `apply?`), so Loogle is your friend.

## Closing branches

Once there are nothing about Clean and the goal is just about math, the proof branch is about to be closed.

* When `aesop` or `grind` quickly solves a goal, that proof is very maintainable.
* When it's about natural numbers, addition, equality and less-than, `omega` or `linarith` might be useful.
* When it's about `1 + 1` and `2` (as field elements), or distributing multiplication over addition, try `ring_nf` or `field_simp`.
