# Raw analogues of Addition8Full and Addition8

This file defines `RawFormalCircuit` versions of `Addition8Full.circuit` and
`Addition8.circuit`, demonstrating that **a single `circuit_proof_all_raw [...]` invocation
is sufficient** for circuits whose soundness reduces to a single subcircuit call.

## The key point

`Addition8Full.circuit` (in `Addition8.lean`) wraps `Addition8FullCarry.circuit` as a
subcircuit.  Its standard `FormalCircuit` proof uses the `ConstraintsHold.Soundness`
definition, which automatically replaces the subcircuit constraint with its `Spec`:

```lean
-- Standard FormalCircuit proof (one simp_all):
soundness := by simp_all [circuit_norm,
  Addition8FullCarry.circuit, Addition8FullCarry.Assumptions, Addition8FullCarry.Spec]
```

The **raw** version uses `ConstraintsHold`, so the subcircuit constraint appears as a raw
`ConstraintsHoldFlat` term after expansion.  `circuit_proof_all_raw` bridges the gap via
the `subcircuit_norm` step it includes internally:

```lean
-- Raw proof (also one tactic invocation):
soundness := by
  circuit_proof_all_raw [Addition8FullCarry.circuit,
                          Addition8FullCarry.Assumptions, Addition8FullCarry.Spec]
```

`circuit_proof_all_raw [...]` internally performs:
1. `circuit_proof_start [...]`  — introduces params, expands `h_holds` to `ConstraintsHoldFlat`
2. `subcircuit_norm`             — `ConstraintsHoldFlat` → `Subcircuit.Spec` (implication form)
3. `simp [circuit_norm, ...]`   — `Subcircuit.Spec` → `Assumptions → circuit.Spec`
4. `simp_all`                   — applies `h_holds` to `h_assumptions`, closes goal

The same pattern applies to `Addition8.Raw.circuit` which wraps `Addition8Full.circuit`.
