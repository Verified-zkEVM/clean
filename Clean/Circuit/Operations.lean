`FlatOperation` models the operations that can be done in a circuit, in a simple/flat way.

This is an intermediary type on the way to defining the full inductive `Operation` type.
It is needed because we already need to talk about operations in the `Subcircuit` definition,
which in turn is needed to define `Operation`.

This is a low-level way to model a subcircuit:
A flat list of circuit operations, instantiated at a certain offset.

To enable composition of formal proofs, subcircuits come with custom `Soundness` and `Completeness`
statements, which have to be compatible with the subcircuit's actual constraints.
