# State Transition with +1 Source and -1 Sink

This file formalizes a foundational result about state transition systems.

## Setup

Given:
- `S`: A finite set of states
- `T ⊆ S × S`: A set of allowed transitions
- `R`: A run, represented as a nat-multiset on `T` (for each transition `t ∈ T`,
  `R(t)` counts how many times the transition is used)

## Net Flow

For each state `x`, we can compute the net flow `R#(x)` as:
```
R#(x) = (sum of R(t) for all t = ⟨x, ·⟩) - (sum of R(t) for all t = ⟨·, x⟩)
```

This represents outflow minus inflow for state `x`.

## Main Result

**Proposition**: If `R#(s) = 1`, `R#(d) = -1`, and `R#(x) = 0` for all other states,
then there exists a cycle-free path from `s` to `d` following transitions in `R`.

## Proof Sketch

1. If `R` contains a cycle, we can remove it. The resulting `R'` is smaller and still
   satisfies the net flow conditions.
2. After removing all cycles, we have a DAG structure.
3. The states reachable from `s` form a finite DAG, which must have at least one leaf `l`.
4. Since `l` has incoming edges but no outgoing edges in `R`, we have `R#(l) < 0`.
5. The only state with negative net flow is `d`, so `l = d`.
6. Therefore, `d` is reachable from `s` via a cycle-free path.
