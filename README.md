# cLean

This repository is currently a playground for the team at zkSecurity to explore and master Lean.

Its intended to become our monorepo for Lean utilities, libraries, etc.

## Using the repo

Follow [official instructions](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html) to install `elan` (the package manager) and Lean4.

Clone this repo, and test that everything works by building:

```bash
lake build
```

After that, we recommend open the repo in VSCode to get immediate inline feedback from the compiler while writing theorems.

Make sure to install the `lean4` extension for VSCode!
